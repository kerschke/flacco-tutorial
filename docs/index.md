# flaccoTutorial

This tutorial introduces you to the calculation of landscape features using the [**flacco** R package](https://github.com/kerschke/flacco) and its graphical user interface [**flaccoGUI**](https://flacco.shinyapps.io/flacco/).

The current version of the package can be downloaded from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/flacco/). If you want to use the most recent (eventually not stable) version, you can obtain the developers version from [GitHub](https://github.com/kerschke/flacco). 

**flacco** also has an interface into Python via the pflacco package that can be obtained from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pflacco/). pflacco also contains some additional features that are not jet implemented in R.

You should have a look at the [Quick Start R](quickstart.md) page in order to get to know the basics of **flacco** or at the [Quickstart GUI](quickstart_gui.md) to familiarize yourself with the basics of its GUI. If you need more detailed information, you should also check the other pages of this tutorial. They introduce concepts that are specific to the different kinds of [features](feat.md) and their [visualization](viz.md).

If you have any questions or comments on **flacco**, feel free to use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/kerschke/flacco/issues) or [send me an e-mail](pascal.kerschke@â€‹tu-dresden.de).
