# Visualisations
In addition to the features themselves, **flacco** provides tools for visualizing the results. This way, one can visualize the *Cell Mapping* of a feature object, draw the corresponding *Barrier Trees* or plot the *Information Content*.
In addition, the so-called *Feature Importance Plot* might be useful when analyzing the influence of each feature, e.g. after a feature selection.

Be aware of the fact that all plots related to *Cell Mapping* (i.e. `plotCellMapping`, `plotBarrierTree2D` and `plotBarrierTree3D`) can only be executed on 2-dimensional problems!
